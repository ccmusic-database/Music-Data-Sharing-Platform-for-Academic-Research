# Music-Data-Sharing-Platform-for-Computational-Musicology-Research
This platform is a multi-functional music data sharing platform for computational musicology research.  It contains many music datas such as the sound information of Chinese traditional musical instruments and the labeling information of Chinese pop music, which is available for free use by computational musicology researchers.

This platform is also a large-scale music data sharing platform specially used for Computational Musicology research in China, including 3 music databases: Chinese Traditional Instrument Sound Database (CTIS), Midi-wav Bi-directional Database of Pop Music and Multi-functional Music Database for MIR Research (CCMusic). All 3 databases are available for free use by computational musicology researchers. For the contents contained in the database, we will provide audio files recorded by the professional team of the conservatory of music, as well as corresponding labelled files, which have no commodity copyright problem and facilitate large-scale promotion. We hope that this music data sharing platform can meet the one-stop data needs of users and contribute to the research in the field of Computational Musicology.

  Chinese Traditional Instrument Sound Database (CTIS)

This database collects sound information about Chinese traditional musical instruments. The database includes 287 Chinese national musical instruments, including traditional musical instruments, improved musical instruments and ethnic minority musical instruments.

  Multi-functional Music Database for MIR Research

This database collects sound materials of pop music, folk music and hundreds of national musical instruments, and makes comprehensive annotation to form a multi-purpose music database for MIR researchers.

  Midi-wav Bi-directional Database of Pop Music
 
This database contains hundreds of Chinese pop songs, and each song contains the corresponding midi-audio-lyric information. Among them, recording the vocal part and accompaniment part of audio independently is helpful to study the MIR task under the ideal situation. In addition, the information of singing techniques consistent with vocal part (such as breath sound, falsetto, breathing, vibrato, mute, slide, etc.) is marked in MuseScore, which constitutes a Midi-Wav bi-direction corresponding pop music database.
